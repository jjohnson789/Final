Follow the prompts to play this text choose your own adventure game. The plan for this application was to create a fun, simple, western-themed text adventure game with different outcomes depending on the choices made by the user. This is what is reflected in this application. If I had more time to work on this program, I would try to add more choices in the story, make it where if the user put in a wrong input, instead of ending the game and starting over, they would be re-prompted to try again.
